# Business Problem
Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death and injury in the United States. They also require significant resources from police departments, EMT services, and hospitals. Being able to accurately predict the number of car accidents within a given area on a given day would help individuals assess their level of risk when going out on the road and help these institutions properly prepare and allocate resources.
